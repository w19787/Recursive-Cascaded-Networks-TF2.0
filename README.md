## This repository is tensorflow 2.0 migration version of origin git project(https://github.com/microsoft/Recursive-Cascaded-Networks)

## Introduction

We propose *recursive cascaded networks*, a general architecture that enables learning deep cascades, for deformable image registration. The proposed architecture is simple in design and can be built on any base network. The moving image is warped successively by each cascade and finally aligned to the fixed image; this procedure is recursive in a way that every cascade learns to perform a progressive deformation for the current warped image. The entire system is end-to-end and jointly trained in an unsupervised manner. Shared-weight techniques are developed in addition to the recursive architecture. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on both liver CT and brain MRI datasets for 3D medical image registration. For more details, please refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12353).

Please unzip the downloaded files into the "datasets" folder. Details about the datasets and the preprocessing stage can be found in the paper.

## Pretrained Models

You may download the following pretrained models and unzip them into the "weights" folder.

For liver CT scans,

* [3-cascade VTN](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uLb0mNxgvwWMxzNKvF1xVnnbgLlCjEfU)
* [10-cascade VTN](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ECGIXccx2vhybrWff7DWW6keAjilEZcT)
* [5-cascade VoxelMorph](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-p4AHHZKoMDIIg6Be5RK3h9QOeVpOPTA)

For brain MRIs,

- [3-cascade VTN](https://drive.google.com/open?id=14wFJZMnkk2SQXcWH3LQBxQJZhLWvsV3n)
- [10-cascade VTN](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bvHG_g5NRS6Ek6aNEgMb9bIfYaCk62Mp)
- [5-cascade VoxelMorph](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oSiHE2G4R5SuYtt6FVu_ayQ_t9UN3HgB)

## Evaluation

If you wish to evaluate the pretrained [10-cascade VTN (for liver)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ECGIXccx2vhybrWff7DWW6keAjilEZcT) for example, please first make sure that the evaluation datasets for liver CT scans, [SLIVER, LiTS, and LSPIG](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xQMmYk9S8En2k_uavytuHeeSmN253jKo), have been placed into the "datasets" folder. For evaluation on the SLIVER dataset (20 * 19 pairs in total), please run:

`python eval.py -c weights/VTN-10-liver -g YOUR_GPU_DEVICES`

For evaluation on the LiTS dataset (131 * 130 pairs in total, which might be quite slow), please run:

`python eval.py -c weights/VTN-10-liver -g YOUR_GPU_DEVICES -v lits`

For pairwise evaluation on the LSPIG dataset (34 pairs in total), please run:

`python eval.py -c weights/VTN-10-liver -g YOUR_GPU_DEVICES -v lspig --paired`

`YOUR_GPU_DEVICES` specifies the GPU ids to use (default to `0`), split by commas with multi-GPU support, or `-1` if CPU only. Make sure that the number of GPUs specified evenly divides the `BATCH_SIZE` that can be specified using `--batch BATCH_SIZE` (default to `4`). The proposed shared-weight cascading technique can be tested using `-r TIMES_OF_SHARED_WEIGHT_CASCADES` (default to `1`).

When the code returns, you can find the result in "evaluate/*.txt".

Similarly, to evaluate the pretrained [10-cascade VTN (for brain)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bvHG_g5NRS6Ek6aNEgMb9bIfYaCk62Mp) on the [LPBA](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19v5-qRF3KwA8Snf5ei-qtMv-nDYyXBzv) dataset:

`python eval.py -c weights/VTN-10-brain -g YOUR_GPU_DEVICES`

Please refer to our paper for details about the evaluation metrics and our experimental settings.

## Training

The following script is for training:

`python train.py -b BASE_NETWORK -n NUMBER_OF_CASCADES -d DATASET -g YOUR_GPU_DEVICES`

`BASE_NETWORK` specifies the base network (default to `VTN`, also can be `VoxelMorph`). `NUMBER_OF_CASCADES` specifies the number of cascades to train (not including the affine cascade), default to `1`.  `DATASET` specifies the data config (default to `datasets/liver.json`, also can be `datasets/brain.json`). `YOUR_GPU_DEVICES` specifies the GPU ids to use (default to `0`), split by commas with multi-GPU support, or `-1` if CPU only. Make sure that the number of GPUs specified evenly divides the `BATCH_SIZE` that can be specified using `--batch BATCH_SIZE` (default to `4`). Specify `-c CHECKPOINT` to start with a previous checkpoint.

### Known issue for this TF2.0 migration [TODO]
- there is issue to support multiple gpus. single gpu training work fine.

## Demo

We provide a demo that directly takes raw CT scans as inputs (only DICOM series supported), preprocesses them into liver crops, and generates the outputs:

`python demo.py -c CHECKPOINT -f FIXED_IMAGE -m MOVING_IMAGE -o OUTPUT_DIRECTORY -g YOUR_GPU_DEVICES`

Note that the preprocessing stage includes cropping the liver area using a threshold-based algorithm, which takes a couple of minutes and the correctness is not guaranteed.

## Built-In Warping Operation with TensorFlow

If you wish to reduce the GPU memory usage, we implemented a memory-efficient warping operation built with TensorFlow 1.4. A pre-built installer for Windows x64 can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=14n4oflK4Su_EkNaJSAMphSbKIpm9zK9R), which can be installed with `pip install tensorflow_gpu-1.4.1-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl`. Please then specify `--fast_reconstruction` in the training and testing scripts to enable this feature. Otherwise, the code is using an alternative version of the warping operation provided by [VoxelMorph](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph).
